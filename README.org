* IOHK Shelley testnet stake pool registry
*** Process
***** Entry submission: stake pool registration

      Stake pool registrants shall provide signed submissions as Github pull
      requests into the testnet pool registry, where they would be subject to
      automated check for well-formedness and human vetting.

***** Entry withdrawal: stake pool de-registration

      This action does not require any changes to the registry -- the inactive
      pools are simply ignored.

***** Changing existing entries:

      TODO: what changes are allowed and what is the process.

*** Semantic content of registry entries

    Generally speaking, the registry entries, taken as a whole, carry the
    following information:

    - the subject identifier (ID), which is a 32-byte public key, in base16 form,
    - stake pool ticker
    - URI of the stake pool's web page
    - an optional "pledge_address"
    - signature, verifiable by the public key

    Precise entry validity rules are described in the following section.

*** Submission well-formedness rules

    1. Submissions shall consist of a single commit, directly off the master
       branch of the IOHK =testnet-stake-pool-registry= repository.
    2. Submissions are identified by the subject's 32-byte public key, which forms
       a 64-character base16 ID string, all lowercase.
    3. Submissions shall either add a new entry, exclusively or modify one.
    4. Submissions shall involve (addition or modification) of exactly two files,
       under the =registry= subdirectory of the repository:
       - the JSON submission entry file, with the ".json" extension (lowercase),
       - the external signature of the file, with the ".sig" extension (lowercase).
    5. The file name part of both files must match the aforementioned ID string,
       up to character case (all lowercase).
    6. Contents of the JSON file:
       1. Must be a JSON object, reasonably (non-offensively) formatted,
       2. With 3 mandatory fields:
          - "id" :: must exactly match the ID string, up to character case (all lowercase),
          - "ticker" :: must be either a 3 or a 4-character long, all-uppercase
                        alphabetic string, formed of ASCII characters,
          - "homepage" :: must be an absolute URL for the stake pool's web page,
       3. And one optional ::
          - "pledge_address" :: a Bech-32 -encoded pledge address.
       4. No other fields are allowed.
    7. The ticker must be unique in the registry,
    8. The external signature file must validate the JSON file,
    9. The commit message must adhere to the following form, exactly:
       - Just one line,
       - ..starting with the ticker name, exactly as specified in the JSON file,
       - ..immediately followed by a column, and then two space characters,
       - ..immediately followed by words either "new" or "modify", reflecting the
         nature of the submission.
